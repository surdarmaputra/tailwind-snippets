## Project Convention

- There's a pre-configured color palette that includes `primary`, `success`, `danger`, `warning` and `dark` colors (configured in `tailwind.config.js`). To reduce complexity in the app, it's recommended to use these colors instead of all colors provided by tailwind.
- Components are grouped using the `atomic-design` principle.
- Commit and PR titles use the conventional commit format.
